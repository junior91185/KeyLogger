# KeyLogger
Caution: Deceptive Elements Detected on This Login Page! ðŸ˜ˆ 

# **Disclaimer**
The login form included in this project does not have real functionality and should not be used for authentication purposes. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a keylogger implementation for educational purposes. 

## Description
While presenting a visually appealing login page styled with CSS for a clean and centered design, the project serves as a dynamic canvas for illustrating the advanced functionality of the keylogger.
My intention in developing this project was not merely to showcase HTML proficiency but, more importantly, to spotlight a fundamental principle in cybersecurity.

## Usage
1. Open the login.html file in a web browser.
2. Enter a username and password in the respective fields.
3. Click on "REVEAL" to give away the location of the keylogger.
4. Keystrokes entered in the username and password fields are recorded and displayed in the Keylogger box.
5. Click on "CONCEAL" to hide the location of the keylogger.

## KeyLogger Functionality
The keylogger records and displays the keystrokes when typing in the username and password fields.
The keylogger box can be opened and closed using the two buttons on the upper left screen.
